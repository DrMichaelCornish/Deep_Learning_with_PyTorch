# Deep Learning with PyTorch 
This repo contains the code used during my read through of Deep Learning with PyTorch by Stevens, Antiga, & Viehmann.

This will mostly contain jupyter notebooks that work through the core concepts, however there is scope to take the project into building models as self-contained modules.

## Organization

The top level organization will be the same as the book: 3 parts and several chapters per part. There may be multiple notebooks to split up sections of the chapters.

There is an extra folder "data" which comes from the github repo for the book 

    https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/tree/master

This is necessary to work through the examples.
